## DESIGN PATTERNS

there are there 3 main groups of design patterns : 
1) Creational : the different ways to create objects
2) structural : the relationships between those objects
3) behavioral : the interaction or communication between those objects.

## BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERNS

1) behavioral design patterns focus on how objects interact with each other and how they communicate to accomplish specific tasks. these patterns address communication, responsibility, and algorithmic issues in object oriented software design. they help in defining clear and efficient communication mechanism between objects and classes.

2) these patterns help in making the design more flexible, extensible and maintainable by promoting better communication and separation of concerns between objects and classes in the system. each pattern addresses specific design issues and provides a standardized solution to common problems enocuntered in software development.
